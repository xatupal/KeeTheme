# DarkTheme
KeePass Plugin

Plugin changes the appearance of KeePass, to make it look better at night. 

You can enable it using hotkey `CTRL+T` or using the menu `Tools -> DarkTheme`.

### Note

KeePass was created using standard Windows controls, which unfortunately were not designed for easy customization. They are extremely resistant to any attempts to change their appearance, especially from a plugin which has no control over their creation.

Therefore the plugin is not perfect and will never be, but is good enough to use it.
